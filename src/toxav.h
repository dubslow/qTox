/* A C++11/Qt5 thin wrapper to the Tox toxav public API in toxav.h.
 * This is a *thin* wrapper, anyone using this is expected to have also
 * read toxcore's header, linked at the bottom of this comment.
 *
 * Having said that, these are some things to know about this wrapper:
 * Since the errors exposed by the core API are largely internal errors,
 * best used for debugging, or external errors that are preventable in clients
 * such that their presence is a bug in the client, it is a design choice that
 * the errors are ignored other than being logged to file, and instead the
 * caller will get an invalid return value (e.g. UINT32_MAX, QString::isNull())
 * In some cases the return value is an enum without an INVALID or similar
 * member of the enum; in such cases the return type is QVariant, which will be
 * QVariant::isNull() on error, or if not, then use QVariant::toInt() and cast
 * to the enum type.
 * Some changes have been made for consistency with Qt conventions. The changes
 * themselves should also be consistent across the API.
 * Note: in some cases, an empty string is valid, so be sure to use isNull()
 * and _not_ isEmpty().
 *
 * Functions are named the same, except in camelCase
 * self_get_nospam becomes getSelfNoSpam, for consistency with Qt conventions
 * Error enums are ignored except for logging purposes
 *   - Return values should instead be tested for success
 * uint8_t arrays for data are converted to/from QByteArrays, and
 * uint8_t arrays for text are converted to/from QStrings
 * Functions that fill an array whose size is provided by another function are wrapped into one,
 *     using the QByteArray/QString objects to handle sizing automatically
 *
 * Otherwise, the documentation from toxav.h applies for all functions here
